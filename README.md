Installation (copied from git://github.com/nelstrom/dotfiles.git)

    git clone https://github.com/meridiangoose/dotfiles.git

Where possible, Vim plugins are installed as git submodules. Check these out by
running the commands:

    cd dotfiles
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Create symlinks:

    ln -s ~/dotfiles/zshrc ~/.zshrc
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/.oh-my-zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/vim ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/.liquidprompt ~/.liquidprompt
    ln -s ~/dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf

# VIM #

My preferences for Vim are stored in `dotfiles/vimrc` 
respectively. All plugins and scripts are stored in the `dotfiles/vim`
directory.

## Adding Plugin Bundles ##

Plugins that are published on github can be installed as submodules. For
example, to install the JavaScript bundle, follow these steps:

    cd ~/dotfiles
    git submodule add http://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript.git vim/bundle/vim-javascript

This will update the `.gitmodules` file by appending something like:

    [submodule "vim/bundle/vim-javascript"]
        path = vim/bundle/vim-javascript
        url = http://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript.git
    
As well as checkout out the git repo into the
`vim/bundle/vim-javascript` directory. You can then commit these changes
as follows:

    git add .
    git ci -m "Added the javascript bundle"

### Command-t

The command-t extension require Vim with ruby support, and furthermore, the
ruby code depends on a C extension for extra speed. The usual pathogen
installation proceedure didn't work for me, but I followed these steps to make
it work:

    cd ~/dotfiles/vim/bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t
    ruby extconf.rb
    make

That did the trick.
